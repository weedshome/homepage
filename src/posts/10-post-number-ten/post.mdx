There are several methods of infusion, from a pure CBD isolate, tinctures, oils, and my current favorite, CBD infused honey. Easy to infuse, a breeze to emulsify, and it lasts a long time.</blockquote>

<h2 title="true">Infuse with what, exactly?</h2>

The effects of CBD are subtle if you have no pain or anxiety, though feeling better is indeed a win. For anxiety or pain management, the results can be dramatic. My preference is to have a bit of THC in my infused foods. But the times that I stick with just craft hemp CBD, I’m delighted with my uplifted mood and lessening of stress. There is no shortage of stress these days.

When dealing with CBD from craft hemp, you need not to fear a second glass of tea, there will be no psychoactive effects. As I explain to CBD newbies, you can anticipate a feeling of wellness, but you will not get high and you will not get the munchies.

That’s different than THC, which causes feelings of euphoria, and appetite. On the subject of munchies: when you get them, be prepared with some healthy choices in the house so you don’t do what I did last week. It’s strawberry season in Oregon and I literally ate half a strawberry pie. Don’t do that.
